 	<div class="block" id="1">Day ONE
 	    <br>
 	    I asked him to introduce himself through a poem and an image, he wrote me back a poem by Ukranian Poet 
 		<b>Ivan Franko (–Ü–≤–∞–Ω –§—Ä–∞–Ω–∫–æ)</b>
 		<div class="text">
 			Birth of A New Order<br><br>
 			I am the son of the nation,<br>
 			What goes aloft, even though it was locked in a fetters.<br>
 			My shout - work, happiness and freedom!<br>
 			After all, I'm a human, a prologue, not an epilogue.<br>
 		</div>
 		<div class="text">
 			He also drew this image:

 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="2">
 		Day TWO
 		<br>
 		I asked him where is his hometown, he told me he grows up and still lives in <span class="bg">Kyiv, Ukraine</span>.

 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="3">
 		Day THREE
 		<br>
 		I asked him how did he get into making typography, he had a quite personal response:
 		<div class="text">I start(ed to) work with type design few years ago because I see big national idea in me and my country. Really big challenge to develop Cyrillic.<br>&emsp;&emsp;You know where I am from, I think you look world news , so hope you understand that my national idea of fight for identity is now, and my work is now, about all of this. <br>&emsp;&emsp;I live and see how my country start be free from imperial occupation from firstly imperial russia, usssr, russian federation. It‚Äôs all about one, about what is freedom.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I want to change visual environment around me. Make ads on street better, make interface better. More character, unique, individually. I think my interest in form new Ukraine font of letter. It‚Äôs why you see in my fonts letter like this -—ü- not like this -—Ü-. It‚Äôs letter 'Tse'.<br>

 		</div>

 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="4">
 		Day FOUR
 		<br>
 		I asked him what's his relationship with his practice, he did not restain himself within typography or graphic design solely.
 		<div class="text">
 			[...]typography is only one form. I start a draw in 3-4 years old, my grandmother be a oil painter, so a lot of time I grew up in her workspace. So, my relationship with my practise it‚Äôs - live. It‚Äôs what I do all of my live and hope do it to my last day ü§ç
 		</div>


 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="5">
 		Day FIVE
 		<br>
 		I asked him to show some of his process for his work.
 		<div class="text">
 			<img id="padding-top" src="images/process1.png" alt="handlettering1">
 			<img id="padding-top" src="images/process2.png" alt="handlettering2">
 		</div>

 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="6">
 		Day SIX
 		<br>
 		I asked him where does he work, apart from his own typographic work.
 		<div class="text">
 			 I use this crazy local graphic reception for my work, like really eye-catchy Color‚Äôs or composition. I think in post-Soviet country we have a lot of interesting visual logic.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It‚Äôs because capitalism come to us only in 1990, part of the city build with logic about one store for one community. <br>&emsp;&emsp;But in real world it‚Äôs not work like this. So, now we have ‚Äúsmall architecture forms‚Äù, it‚Äôs street small store.
 		</div>

 	</div>
 	<div class="block" id="7">
 		Day SEVEN
 		<br>
 		We were in a deep converstion about how the embodied experience has contribured into our artistic output, special the surrounding environment growing up. he traced back to some childhood memories:
 		<div class="text">
 			In USSR we didn‚Äôt have money and magazine, coffee shop and mall. All of this small and medium business system work because we have system where supply (is the) demand.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It‚Äôs so important to understand what's the start of the formal logic when we work, like what is be first in graphic and communication. Because graphic design and typography firstly for me it‚Äôs about communication. And (enough) historical background, I think, make really full solutions and results.
 		</div>
 		He also shared some of his paintings and doodles.
 		<div class="text">

 		<div class="block" id="...">
 			Days After ...
 			<br>
 			I am stilling waiting for him to sending me more images and clarify some of his answers, but I think I need to be more patient, as he is experiencing the national crisis and in quite a sorrow about what his community is going through.<br>&emsp;&emsp; I had no idea where he is resided when approaching him for this interview. However, somehow we are both glad this interview happened during this turbulent time, where he could talk about what he is passionate about at ease.
